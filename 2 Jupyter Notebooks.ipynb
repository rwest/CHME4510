    "## What is the Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "We'll work extensively with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/notebook.html) (formerly IPython Notebooks) in this course. They are media-rich documents that combine text with markown formatting, typeset mathematics with MathJax, and executable Python statements.\n",

    "\n",

    "```Bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Below the toolbars, you'll see a single code cell, prepended with `In [ ]:`.  This cell can contain an arbitrarily long code segment, but we'll start with a simple one liner.  In that lone code cell, type\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and then hit *Shift+Enter*.  If you just hit Enter you'll find that it will simply add another line to the current cell.  So remember, **to execute a cell**, it's **Shift+Enter**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So what happened?  We've assigned the label x to the number 5.  And also you should see that the label of that cell will now read `In[1]:` because that's the first statement we've executed in this Python kernel.  You'll also notice that the notebook has created a new cell, since we already used the only existing cell.  \n",
    "\n",

    "Don't worry too much about what the \"kernel\" is, but the main point to remember here is that we can assign a variable in one cell but still access it in a separate cell.  The cells are ways for *us* to divide up our thoughts and our code, but everything is connected underneath.  "
